## Luxury and streetwear designer brands (clothing)
- Scraping data for use in upcoming personal machine learning projects.
- All brands scraped will be listed on completition
- Each brand has categories like outerwear (some may end up as jacket/coat/vest etc.), denim, suitwear, bottoms, etc scrapped for each available product.
- All products and their details, including the category, will be saved in each brand's csv to be used as features in ml models or neural networks
<br><br>
If things go smooth n easy as it is so far, may attempt first image recognition clustering with certain products' images (graphic/stitches/etc. clothings) for patterns

# Side Notes
- If you use this for the scraper, you may scroll directly to elements if using chrome/explorer/etc for driver; with firefox scrolling has to be to specific positions because of a browser bug (has to be patched by selenium, doesnt effect users)
